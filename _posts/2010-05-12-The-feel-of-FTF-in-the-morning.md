# The feel of FTF in the morning

Yesterday at 23:00 I discovered that the cache 
"[The middle of somewhere](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b7b5bc67-0be4-40b5-b96b-79e64c8a7ad8)"
was published at 16:16, and that noone had found it, or at least had
not posted any FTF (First To Find) logs on geocaching.com. This is a
mystery cache, and I had to recall my old geometry skillz from school
to be able to calculate the coordinates. Then I downloaded a free GPS
waypoint finder program for my iPhone, plotted the coordinates in and
went to bed.

This morning the first thing I did was check my mail to see if there
had been any finders of this cache. It was nothing there, but I was a
bit worried that one of the other regular FTF hunters I know had found
it but not logged it on the website so that other FTF hunters would
come rushing to the scene just to be disappointed by finding a
not-so-much pristine log sheet in the container. A despicable
practice, that.

However, after dropping the kid off to kindergarten and the wife off
to work I went down to see if I got my calculations right. And after
some detours - the iPhone GPS isn't all that.. - I had to use the hint to start
bruteforcing possible cache locations. And I found it! And it was an
FTF! There was much rejoicing, and then I went to work :)\

Wondering about the picture? Well, little Halden seems to be a
dangerous town, that's a bullet hole in a sign near the cache!
