# Funny jokes about math

Ok.. this really is a bit geeky, but still: 

e\^x goes to a party with x2. x2 is having a great time but sees that ex is just sitting in the
corner doing nothing.  
He goes over and says to e\^x "hey, come and integrate with us".  
ex replies "No, it won't make any difference."

The best one is of course this one: 

Calculus-based pick-up line:  
"Hey baby, can I take your derivative â€¦ 'cause I want to be tangent to your
curves!" 

A lot more can be found at [something called
wikibooks.org](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Jokebook:Math) And a LOT
MORE can be found [right
here](http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html). Thanks to [Alex
Brasetvik](http://nonsense.brasetvik.com/) for this one :)
