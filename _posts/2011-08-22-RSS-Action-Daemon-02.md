# RSS Action Daemon 0.2

I recently had some use for a program that could download a RSS and then notify me over SMS if there were any new entries. I could not find anything
useful on the internets except rssdler - but that one is just geared towards content download as far I could see.

So I remembered an old script I made back in 2005. After ironing out
some bugs I got it working again :)

Without further ado: [RSS Action Daemon 0.2](http://ormset.no/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rssdaemon-0.2.tar.gz)
