# NTP Vandalism

Poul-Henning Kamp (PHK) of Denmark is fighting the big windmill D-Link.  

They have included the name of his NTP server in the firmware of their
products, thus generating a lot of unwanted traffic to his
server. This extra traffic results in PHK having to pay the Danish
Internet eXchange (DIX) a lot of money for bandwith. 

D-link is of course not willing to admit to anything, they are both
american and a big company. PHK has an open letter to D-link to be
found here: <http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/dlink/> 

I found this story on [Linux1.no](http://linux1.no/node/1680).
