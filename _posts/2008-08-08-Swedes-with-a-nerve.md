# Swedes with a nerve...

[Unsworn Industries](http://www.unsworn.org/telemegaphone/) has this
"art" project in Western Norway where they have put up a megaphone
that you may call into and then have your voice broadcast uncensored
over the fjord, the mountains and the nearby village. Why? I have no
idea.

I propose we put up one just like it, only a lot bigger, in
Malm√∂, then call it up and play
