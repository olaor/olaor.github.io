# New guitar: G-sharp!

[![IMG_2156](http://ormset.no/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2156.jpg)](http://ormset.no/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2156.jpg)

For
some years now I had been aware of the G-Sharp, G#, Giss or OF-1
guitar \([no](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Sharp)|[en](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-sharp_guitar)\)
made by luthier [Øivin Fjeld](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98ivin_Fjeld). 

This guitar is a solid body electric guitar with a short scale - it's
G#-G# tuning is similar to mounting a capo to the fourth fret on a
standard guitar. It just sounds marvelous, and the distance between
the frets fits my fairly small fingers very well. It's also a quality
instrument, built in solid mahogany. After finding one not so far from
where I live online I just went and bought it just before
christmas. After a short round of haggeling it was mine!

When I bought
it the guitar was tuned in the G# tuning, which of course sound
immensly great on it but since I am a lousy guitar player I need help
from some apps to learn playing and those apps do not understand much
else than the normal open E tuning of a standard guitar.

I
needed some help cleaning up and lacquering the neck, fixing the
tuning, getting new strings and fixing the intonations for the new
strings that I would need in an open E. Setting the G-Sharp up for an
open E tuning means getting thicker strings, and then you need to move
the floating bridge around to get the intonation right.... not
something a noob like me should attempt, so I went to see Mr. Fjeld
himself. 

After a while in his [guitar
workshop](https://www.facebook.com/OivinFjeldGitarverksted) on Rolvsøy
my G\# was as good as new! That man does seriously good work, and is
extremely serviceminded - if ever in Norway and need to get your
guitar fixed... he's the man. He also added some shielding and put in
another ground cable to the single coil pickup, a small fix but it
makes for a lot less
distortion.

So. Playing the thing. 

I am still learning to play, so I use apps like Yousician
on my iPad to learn playing. This is also the reason I need an open E
tuning as most apps on the iPad does not recognize other tunings.  

My current practice setup that I use the most looks like this, soundwise:
G-Sharp Guitar -&gt; Fender angled cable -&gt; iRig2 -&gt; iPad -&gt;
Garageband App with guitar amp in the background -&gt; Yousician App
-&gt; iRig2 -&gt; headphones. Just like other great musicians I like
comparing myself to (in my dreams) I really dig the G-Sharp. Very easy
to play on, easy to bring around and sounds very good. Jarle Bernhoft,
Mark Knopfler, Eric Clapton and Elton John just can't be wrong!

And then there's the awesome volume
knob that disappears into the top of the guitar:
