# HTC Desire HD/Android 2.2/HTC Sense vs. iPhone/iOS4

As previously mentioned, I am now an Android user. This is not by
choice, it's some sort of political decision on my workplace that
iPhones are strictly forbidden. Android phones, on the other hand, is
allowed. So when my old private iPhone 3G started getting slow due to
more advanced features in iOS4 I had to switch to Android in order to
get a phone from my employer, which is something they are
contractually bound to provide me with while I am working there.

So, how does the HTC Desire HD stack up to the iPhone? We'll find out.

**Exterior**

The Desire HD seems quite solid, it's frame is carved out from a
single block of aluminium. However, they are using two very cheap
plastic lids to cover the battery and SIM/SD card slots. The cover for
the SIM/SD cards stands out from the back of the phone, and the
battery lid is very difficult to open and close. What is far worse is
the buttons on the Desire HD - it has quite rounded edges and the
low-profile buttons are placed on the screen-side of the body's
rounded edges making them horribly difficult to locate and press. It's
very very annoying compared to the iPhone's very easily located
buttons. The only thing the Desire HD has got going for itself in this
category is the placement of the 3.5 mm audio jack, which is at the
bottom where it should be. However, this does not matter as I use a
Jabra BT3030 over bluetooth both for music and hands-free anyway.

And what is up with placing the speaker on the back side of the phone? It's unusable for

Winner: **iPhone**.

**Battery Life**

The battery life on the Desire HD is a joke. If one is to actually use
it's smartphone features like the sync, notification and network
connectivity the battery drains in a matter of hours. To make the
battery last any longer than 5-6 hours before recharge one has to turn
down screen brightness to a minimum, turn off all kind of network
connectivity, never make any phone calls and religiously kill
applications with a third-party application like 
[Advanced Task Killer](http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/productivity/advanced-task-killer_lfv.html). To
be able to use this phone as a business phone one needs to have an
abundance of chargers and plug it in constantly. Not a very mobile
phone, really. Even the iPhone will last you 14 hours and then some
without being constantly recharged.

Winner: **iPhone**.

**PIM Applications**

Address book and Calendar applications are very important to me. The address book on the Desire HD is quite OK, but synchronizing private contacts is
a mess if you do not want to import all private contacts into your corporate Exchange server or give Google control over your data. I had to shell out
a lot of pennies for [MarkSpace Missing sync](http://www.markspace.com/products/android/missing-sync-android.html) in order to sync my contacts from
my Mac over to the Desire HD. With the iPhone this is completely seamless and does not require any third party apps or vendors.

Getting Caldav calendars to work on the Desire HD is a no-go. The only way is with [Calendar Sync BETA from
Hypermatix](http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/libraries_and_demo/calendar-caldav-sync-beta_fqks.html), which does not work on the Desire
HD. On the iPhone? Guess once.

Do you want to cancel a meeting on the Desire HD? Ok, you can delete the Calendar Event, but the organizer of the meeting will not get notified that
you canceled. Seriously. This alone makes the Desire HD unusable as a business phone in my not so humble opinion.

Winner: **iPhone**. By far.

**Email**

Exchange email works well on the Desire HD, push mail is supported and works. IMAP IDLE is, as on the iPhone, not supported in the default email
client. But unlike the iPhone there are alternate email clients that supports IDLE and gives you push functionality even for IMAP. The ability to save
and attach any file type is also a plus on the Desire HD.

Winner: **Desire HD**

**Third party Applications**

Installing apps on the Desire HD is a breeze, since Android Market downloads and installs apps in the background. However, the general usability, look
and feel of applications are way better on iPhone. On Android, developers are given a lot more freedom to cook up their own "usability" schemes, so
usability is radically different from application to application. Quite annoying.

Also, everyone is at the moment developing iPhone (and iPad) apps so the selection of quality apps are better on the iPhone, and they get the new apps
first. This may change as Android is more widely adopted.

Also you will have no guarantees as to what the hell you are REALLY installing on your Android, there are no quality or security control done on
Android apps like on the iPhone.

Winner: **iPhone**

**Customizability**

Should be a walk-over for Android. Steve is the ruler of the iPhone, and he decides how things should look. No themes or tweaks are allowed on the
iPhone, and for those that like that kind of fun the Android is the way to go. Some of us, like me, is quite willing to forget customilization over
other functionality. But Android can have this small and unimportant victory.

Winner: **Android**

**Freedom**

The Android zealots are touting that Android is Linux and Linux is Free as in Freedom etc etc ad nausaeum. But you still have to root your device in
order to get, say, something so basic as the possibility to take screenshots. And [rooting your Desire
HD](http://pocketnow.com/android/how-to-root-your-htc-desire-hd) involves a LOT of work, while rooting an iPhone is mostly done by [downloading an
application](http://redsn0w.com/) for your PC and pressing one button.

Winner: **iPhone**

**Accessories**

The accessory market for iPhones is huge, and you can get stuff for almost free from Asia, like from [DealExtreme](http://www.dealextreme.com/). HTC
Desire HD accessories are harder to get by, and if you find any you'll need to get them at a premium price from an authorized dealer - the shadow
market aren't really THAT interested in making a lot of accessories for phones that are only sold for a limited time before a new model with different
physical appearance is released.

Winner: **iPhone**

**Price**

The Desire HD and a iPhone4 costs roughly the same. However, if you get an Desire HD you have to invest in extra software for sync and a lot of
chargers for your office/home/car/laptop bag and extra batteries so the total price tag is much higher than for the iPhone.

Winner: **iPhone**

**Conclusion:**

Get an iPhone. The Desire HD eats battery, has poor build quality and the PIM applications that you rely on aren't as good as on the iPhone. The
iPhone, well, just works.
