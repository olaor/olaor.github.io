# The Episode of the Lost Keys

I am quite forgetful. Actually, I am VERY forgetful. So yesterday I forgot my keys on the train. All of them.

-   Keys for the Mercedes
-   Keys for the Primera
-   Keys to work
-   Keys for our house
-   Keys for all gun-related locks
-   Even keys for the pillowbox in the garden.

Getting them back was like walking through a tar-pit... Read the rest!

I happened to misplace my keys in a yellow plastic bag I was carrying with me to Oslo. The bag was placed on the shelf above me on the train, and of
course I **forgot** it when I left the train :(

I panicked, even though the Book says not to.

So I started calling Lost-and-found at the railways company, but nothing had turned up. I called customer service and asked if they could locate the
carriages on that particular departure so that I could call them up and check for my missing stuff so that I could know that everything was going to
be all right. But no way, that was really really really impossible. So I went on the train home again, and tried calling Lost-and-Found for 1.5 hours
- and they didn't even bother picking up. Probably too busy, but still.

I told a conducteur about my misplacement, and he came back 5 min later with the train number an geographical location of that particular carriage.
And this was claimed to be impossible. But he said he couldn't do more about it.

BUT luckily I forgot my sweater on the way home, and when I found the carriage it was in I told the train driver about my problem. So he got on the
phone and located the keys by talking directly to on-board personnel at train 73004 that was in Stavanger (far from where I live) and made them secure
my keys!! That's what I call service! So now I am just waiting for them to arrive at Lost+Found :)
