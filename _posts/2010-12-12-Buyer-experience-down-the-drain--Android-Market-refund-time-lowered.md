# Buyer experience down the drain - Android Market refund time lowered.

One of the great features of the Android Market was the easy way to get refunds if that pricey app you bought didn't fit your needs. Now they are
[reducing the refund time](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/12/android-market-client-update.html) from 24 hours to 15 - fifteen - minutes!
Wow. I was going to go through the store and test time tracker applications, and I can't thourogly test a time tracker application in only fifteen
minutes. That sort of app needs to be tested in a real-life setting, testing export possibilities and ease of tracking multiple projects/tasks etc.
Even in socialist Norway we don't have 15 minute workdays.

Same goes for GPS apps, getting a proper fix takes almost 15 minutes in some cases, how can one find out if the app is good enough in such a small
time period?

Please, Android Market developers, don't ruin the buying experience. If you need to lower it from 24 hours, how about giving us at least 12, 6 or 3
hours refund time? 15 minutes is a joke for people testing more advanced applications.
